* Introduction
This file provides a set of configurations for the tools I used most often in my daily work and development.

* ZSH
I use zsh as the default shell and use oh my zsh to manage it, powerlevel10k is the zsh theme I currently use. Below is the command to install them
#+begin_src shell
# install and change default shell to zsh
sudo apt install -y zsh && chsh -s $(which zsh)
# install oh my zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
# install powerlevel10k
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
# install plugins
# zsh-autosuggestions
git clone --depth=1  https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
#zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
#+end_src
After this create a symbolic link to the .zshrc file in the directory at ~~/.zshrc~ and do
#+begin_src shell
ln -s ~/dotconfig/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
#+end_src
By right the p10k configuration menu will popup, go through it should make it work.

* TMUX
Version must be greater than 3.3, if package manager version is lower than than, can try to compile latest from source.
 #+begin_src shell
 ## compile latest from source
 sudo apt install -y libevent-dev
 ./configure && make -j$(proc)
 sudo make install

git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
ln -s ~/dotconfig/tmux/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
 #+end_src
 Use prefix+I to install tpm plugins
